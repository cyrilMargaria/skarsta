# What's all this

In the original design, pulley on the encoder did seize the encoder, because the belt tension was transfered on the encoder itself.  In addition the mounts on the encoder on the case broke.
The "fix" is a (failed) attempt to have the belt tensioning force on the 3D printed pieces
- encoder-fix: insert to match the encoder and hols in the case
- encoder-pulley-v2: pulley with flange 
- spacer and spacer-second: capture the encoder-pulley 

This design also failed, I reverted to the usensor. 

Next rounds should
 - alignement points for spacers 
 - re-design with roller skate bearings capturing the encoder pulley
 - adjustable tensioner
 
Other design consideration: 
 - encoder inline with the motor shaft on the back (case redign to be considered, sources missing :-( )
